# class-scheduler
Python program that produces a
schedule for a class that repeats on specified
days of the week. The command-line inputs are:

1. The names of the classes,
2. The start date,
3. The available days of the week,
4. Any unavailable dates, such as holidays (optional).

At this time, the classes are in the code (blech!).

Future versions will:
1. Support external class names, probably file-based.
2. Support external unavailable days, or default holidays.
